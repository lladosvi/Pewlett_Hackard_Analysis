# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to help Bobby and Pewlett Hackard undertsand the number of people retiring by title and also then identify employees that are eligible to participate in the mentornship program both based on age and status in the company. 

## Results
### Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title:
* By far the largest amount of retiring employees will come from more senior positions incluing Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. 70% of retirees will come from these positions. The main concern is if we have enough pipeline of younger employees to be promoted and coached into these positions. 
* By far the smalles amount of retiring employees will come from the Manager position. The concern here is do we have enough rotation in the management positions to manage a new and younger incoming population and to drive newness, change and creativity. There are only 2 Managers retiring out of more than 70k retiring in total.

### Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program:
* There are 1,549 employees elegible for the mentorship program. That is a concern as with more than 70 retiring, the thinking is that this pool is not sufficient to help with the replacement of retirees.
